🛡️ OpSecPulse
🧬 Founder’s Lore

OpSecPulse was founded from lived experience — forged at the intersection of adversity, cybersecurity, and divine conviction.

After years of working in vulnerability management, security compliance, the founder saw gaps in the way organizations approach cyber risk: fragmented tooling, reactive processes, and inaccessible automation.

This platform was built to change that.

OpSecPulse empowers public and private sectors with AI-enhanced cyber operations, KEV threat intelligence, and automated scan orchestration — all aligned with UK Cyber Strategy, MoD innovation objectives, and resilience by design.

We believe national security begins with operational clarity.
We believe automation should enable action, not just alerts.
We believe defense tech should be built by those who’ve lived the need.

Defend the Edge. Secure the Core. Deliver the Light.
